Variables are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.

In short, a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable.

Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types. In JavaScript, we use the let keyword to declare variables.

To initialize a variable, we use the following format:

let variableName = value;
In JavaScript, there's only one numeric data type: Number. It can represent both integers and floating-point numbers.

For example:

To initialize a variable with an integer value:

let a = 3;
To initialize a variable with a floating-point value:

let b = 13.2;
JavaScript automatically handles the number type, whether it's an integer or a floating-point number.
